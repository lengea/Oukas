<h2>We believe every student should have<br>
	the right to focus on their studies,<br> not their finance.</h2>

<h3>Study now, Pay later Model</h3>

<p>With our model, students can focus on their studies<br>
	while we and our partners take care of the tuition fees.<br>
	Once the student graduates, he/she will work for their<br>
	supported partner for a set period of time until the<br>
	tuition fee is paid back in full.</p>

<p>Students have the options to repay from 10% to 50%<br>
of their monthly salary to best suit their needs.</p>
